# Random_Old_Programs
A collection of my old programs

### Basic Game Series:
  My first attempts at making a game  
  I had to manually code in physics, so it looks weird  
  Basic Game touch I made to play on my phone, which had a sliding keyboard and a touchscreen.  

### Genetic Algorithm:
  Simple genetic algorithms to train circles to move across the screen
  
### Insect Simulation:
  Simulates surface foraging behavior of Ants  
  Has many settings:
  * Preset hive locations.  
  * Manual placement of objects.  
  * Pheremone trails.  

still has some **bugs** (*pun intended*)

### Ready Steady Bang:
  My version of the game Ready, Steady, Bang!
  Can be played on computer or on an android phone

### Shooting Range:
A shooting range game
3 types of targets:
* Red - tap as fast as possible
* Blue - don't tap
* Red and Blue (hostage) - wait for ready signal

### Battleship:
   My battleship game written in Racket  
   Current AI only shoots randomly
